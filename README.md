#Rockaways Water Weather App

Expanded version at  https://marine-weather.herokuapp.com

Find out the water temperature and swell height for your next surf, swim or boating session at the Rockaways!

* Technologies Used: Node.js and Express as server, Angular to render front-end, Materialize for CSS styling, external APIs - World Weather Online and Google Maps

* Learned: How to hide my API key by requesting API server side and storing key in .env which is hidden from Github. How to use external weather API and parse the data to render the values I want using Angular.

* The weather pulls from one location, the Rockaways, and the map is currently set there as well. I am working on an expanded weather app that uses Mongo at https://github.com/mmmfang/marine-weather
